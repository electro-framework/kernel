# Kernel

##### The framework's core, installable as a Composer package

Electro is a highly modular framework. The majority of the framework's functionality is provided by internal modules, called subsystems. As such, the framework's core (the kernel) provides only the minimum core functionality that is shared between all of the framework's subsystems, which is:

1. Dependency Injection,
1. Module management,
1. Bootstrapping.

The kernel's main responsability is loading and initializing (in this order):

1. The framework subsystems,
1. The installed plugins,
1. The application's private modules.

## Installation

**Do not install this package directly.**

Instead, install the installation profile that is more suitable for your application's needs.

Usually, you will want to install the `electro/framework` package, which provides a standard installation for a generic web framework.

If you would prefer a different configuration profile (ex. a micro-framework), please search for a suitable package on GitHub's `electro-framework` organization.

#### Recommended

Use Electro's [base installation](https://github.com/electro-framework/electro) as your application's starting point.
